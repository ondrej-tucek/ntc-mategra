The article
<h2 class="article-title">Porous micro/nano structured oxidic titanium surface decorated
  with silicon monoxide
</h2>
represents the research concept of the joint project NTC and UKR:

  Advanced porous biomaterials functionalized with stem cells for enhanced implant osseointegration.
</div>
<div class="pb-4 is-justify">
  Novel types of titanium oxidic surfaces were fabricated by a shifted Laser Surface
  Texturing of titanium in air, producing porous micro/nanostructured topography, and
  by a subsequent Nd:YAG laser-induced reactive deposition of Ti5Si3 titanium silicide
  in vacuum, coating this topography with scattered sub-micron particles of silicon
  monoxide.
</div>
<div class="pb-4 is-justify">
  Both pristine and SiO-modified laser-structured surfaces were examined for the response
  of human SCP-1 and murine MC3T3 cells and found biocompatible in terms of cell survival,
  proliferation and cell morphology.
